name="Trigger Manager"
description="Trigger Manager is a plugin for Godot that allows you to create and manage a list of timed triggers directly from the Inspector. Each trigger uses SceneTreeTimer to fire events at the configured time, and when activated, the plugin emits a signal containing the corresponding trigger name. Ideal for sequences, cutscenes, gameplay logic, and any situation where it's necessary to schedule actions in a simple, organized, and centralized way."
