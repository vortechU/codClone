name="Godot 3D Cursor"
description="This plugin for the Godot Engine implements a 3D cursor, offering functionality similar to Blender’s 3D cursor.\n\nNote: Due to certain engine limitations, you must switch to a tab other than 3D (e.g., 2D, Script, or AssetLib) and back to 3D once after enabling this plugin, and also upon engine startup, to activate the plugin correctly.\n\nUsage: You can set the 3D cursor's position by using Shift + Right Click.\n\nVersion 1.2: The Pie Menu / Undo-Redo Update\n\nIn this update, I’ve added a Pie Menu, similar to Blender’s, which can be invoked with Shift + S. This menu displays commands found in the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and offers faster access to desired functionality.\n\nAnother major feature in this version is the Undo-Redo functionality. This should be straightforward, except for the ‘Remove 3D Cursor from Scene’ command, which is intentionally not undoable, as it frees the cursor object itself."
